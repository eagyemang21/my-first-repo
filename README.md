I am an energetic Brooklyn native who thrives off enthusiasm and new things. I am mostly excited about geting started on Marcy Lab this year and that we will 
be learning new material, but also make wonderful connections and healthy bonds along the way. I hope to be seen as a ray of sunshine, not only for my cohort,
but for the program in general and paving paths for those next to come.
